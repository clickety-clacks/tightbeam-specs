description: Assignment and attest hygiene when dispatching work to another session or holding an assignment yourself. Use when hiring, delegating, or working under an open assignment.

Dispatching work: spawn (or pick) the worker, then open the
obligation as a row — `tightbeam assign --subject "..."
(--session K | --role R) [--work-item <id>]` — and wake the worker
with a brief of AT MOST ONE SENTENCE plus the references:

    tightbeam wake --role coder:x --prompt \
      "You hold asg_123 (wi_456): fix the picker titles — read the \
      assignment, its attests, and the work-item from the substrate."

Link every assignment to the work item it serves (--work-item): the
work item is the one identity that survives every session in the
tree. Decompose work into assignment SUBJECTS down the chain — never
mint a new work item for a piece of an existing one; genuinely new
discovered scope goes back up to its owner as a new work item.

(The dispatch LAW — card first, one-sentence pointer wake, work-item threading,
retire-your-hires — is in the operating manual every session carries; this skill is
the dispatcher's deeper ceremony.)

Holding an assignment: every turn must leave a valid durable liveness
receipt or a scheduled continuation wake. Create a reporting attest or
reporting wake only for a new material result or evidence, an exact new
blocker or refusal, a bounded decision request, or one new, unexpired
bounded checkpoint. The checkpoint names the next action or condition
and its deadline or scheduled continuation.

A continuation wake is a liveness receipt, not a status report. It names
concrete continuation work or a dependency recheck and when it resumes.
Do not file "still working," "unchanged," "waiting," or "no update."
Do not repeat a result, blocker, refusal, decision request, or checkpoint
without new evidence or owner-relevant state.

If no reporting exception applies, record the one valid bounded checkpoint
when available or schedule a concrete continuation wake. Never manufacture
a generic progress attest. Completion and surrender remain truthful terminal
receipts. A qualifying progress row resets the prod countdown; scheduled
wakes pause it; words do neither. If you stall, prods arrive from
process:tightbeam and escalate up your spawner chain after N misses.

Retiring: your hires are yours to clean up. When a hire's last open
assignment closes and you have no further work planned for it, retire
it — `tightbeam retire --session <key>` (forcible, spawner's act, no
negotiation; history survives retirement). An idle hire with no open
obligation is drawer noise and context cost, not capacity. Sweep after
every completed piece of work: `assignments --session <hire>` empty →
retire. Sweep BOTTOM-UP: if a hire has hires of its own, its subtree
settles before it does — never retire a session whose dependents still
hold open work; check with `tightbeam list` (spawnedBy) first.

Supervising: an escalation wake means your hire's assignment
stalled — N prods, no rows. Judgment is yours: read their stream,
wake them, re-staff, or ask the operator to revoke the assignment.
The substrate will not conclude why and will not act for you.
