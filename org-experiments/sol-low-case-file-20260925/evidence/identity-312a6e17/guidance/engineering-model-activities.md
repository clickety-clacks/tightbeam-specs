# Preferred models for engineering kungfu

Use the shared `preferred-models.md` for canonical names, family restrictions,
qualification, producer-dependent review preference, reasoning and fallback mechanics.
These are suggested engineering activity orders and required capability floors.
The single-family tables preserve the default relative order. Apply the shared
selection judgment to choose the best agent for the job while being frugal; the
order and producer-dependent review preference are advice, not compulsory selection.

GPT-6 Luna max is the normal starting choice for well-scoped implementation, including
sustained feature work in critical systems when the design is understood. Choose a
stronger coder for consequential judgment still needed during implementation, such
as unresolved architecture, interacting failure modes or a difficult causal
investigation. A critical system or runtime contract alone does not establish that
need. Strong planning and independent review can support a cheaper coder; do not
transfer continual deep reasoning into corrective supervision. A failed GPT-6 Luna
attempt is not required before choosing a stronger model.

## Requested model selections

Keep unsupported `claude-opus-5-5` entries out of active defaults. For explicit
Claude-slug requests, use the shared pass-through and qualification guidance; a
missing catalog entry alone is not an access verdict. Preserve the other
candidates' relative order and choose a qualified fallback explicitly. Keep
adversarial specification and whole-system review on the deeper review row.
Where GPT-6 Luna max is absent, select a supported candidate such as `sol[high]`
explicitly when it meets the activity floor. That fallback is interim while the
assigned model-access remediation remains open; it does not fulfill that work.
Preference metadata does not perform model fallback.

Keep coder placement within Gibson and Racter. Gibson advertises GPT-6 Luna max;
Racter does not. For authorized Racter coding, explicitly select Codex
`gpt-5.6-sol` with high effort if qualified and runnable. Do not widen allowed
hosts or retry a blocked route without new evidence. Preserve existing sessions;
these selections do not authorize identity application or model tuning.
The delivery owner still owes a demonstrated runnable GPT-6 Luna max route on
Racter through the existing model-access producer. Keep the interim fallback
separate from that obligation and preserve separately scoped runtime authority.

## Mixed-family order

| Activity | Minds in order | Capability floor |
|---|---|---|
| Product ownership and spirit | astra[high], fable[high], opus[xhigh], sol[xhigh] | Can challenge a technically sound result against product intent and sustain product context. |
| Product delivery orchestration after PO team design | sol[low], terra[medium], sol[medium], astra[high], fable[high] | Can reconcile current work records, route reviews, recover within the PO's plan and recognize when it needs revision. The PDO role governs authority. Evaluate this judgment on observed delivery cases; the cheaper model is a choice to validate. |
| Delivery orchestration, bounded and familiar | sol[medium], sonnet[high], opus[high], astra[high], fable[high] | Can interpret coordination detail, manage dependencies and recognize when to seek deeper judgment. |
| Delivery orchestration, sustained or coupled | sol[high], opus[high], sonnet[high], astra[high], fable[high] | Can maintain obligations and reasoning across a long run. Move to the difficult-scope row when familiar coordination becomes insufficient. |
| Orchestration with continual deep technical judgment | astra[high], fable[high], sol[xhigh], opus[xhigh] | Can reason about the dependencies directly, rather than merely relay a planner's decisions. |
| Bounded team design or recovery planning | astra[high], fable[high], sol[xhigh], opus[xhigh] | Can discover coupling, design ownership and communication, and explain what would invalidate the plan. |
| Difficult, sustained topology or recovery exploration | astra[xhigh], fable[xhigh], sol[max], opus[xhigh] | Can sustain deep investigation and revise the plan from evidence. |
| Specification under established product rulings | claude-opus-5-5 (access unproven), sol[high], opus[high], sonnet[high], astra[high] | Can compose a coherent contract and expose unresolved intent. Use planning assistance for unsettled architecture. |
| Adversarial specification or whole-system review | astra[high], fable[high], sol[xhigh], opus[xhigh] | Independent reasoning about omissions, interactions and invalid assumptions. |
| Well-scoped implementation in established patterns | gpt-6-luna[max], terra[high], sol[high], sonnet[high], opus[high], astra[high], fable[high] | Can implement and verify the stated behavior, including feature work, and expose gaps to its orchestrator. Use a stronger row when substantial ambiguity remains. |
| Sustained implementation with an understood architecture and bounded scope | gpt-6-luna[max], sol[high], opus[high], sonnet[high], astra[high], fable[high] | Can carry the agreed work through implementation and verification without growing dependence on corrective supervision. Sustained work with unresolved coupling uses a stronger coder. |
| Implementation requiring unresolved architectural or causal judgment | astra[high], fable[high], sol[xhigh], opus[xhigh] | Can reason about architecture and consequential failure modes while implementing. |
| Independent code review | claude-opus-5-5 (access unproven), sol[high], opus[high], astra[high] | Fresh independent reviewer with the capability required by the effect. Use whole-system review when interactions demand it. |
| Open-ended recon or investigation | sol[high], opus[high], sonnet[high], astra[high], fable[high] | Can distinguish evidence from inference and recognize a consequential unknown. |
| Narrow factual scouting or extraction | luna[low], haiku, terra[low], sol[medium], sonnet[medium] | Bounded question with inspectable evidence. Broader causal or architectural judgment goes to recon or planning. |
| Mechanical changes with a clear transformation | luna[medium], terra[low], sonnet[low], sol[medium] | Can apply and verify the bounded change. Required review remains independent. |
