# Preferred models

Own model selection through this guidance and the installed kungfu's activity table.
Keep canonical names, selection mechanics and substrate activities here. Engineering
activities live in `guidance/engineering-model-activities.md`.

## Working set (capsules)

- **gpt-6-astra** — (nickname: astra): deep product, architecture, planning and review judgment. Use high or higher reasoning for sustained work.
- **gpt-5.6-sol** — (nickname: sol): general engineering and delivery orchestration; increase effort for sustained or coupled work. Can commission a stronger planner.
- **gpt-5.6-terra** — (nickname: terra): bounded engineering implementation and mechanical work with an inspectable contract.
- **gpt-5.6-luna** — (nickname: luna): retain the existing medium-effort mechanical selections and low-effort factual selections.
- **gpt-6-luna**: use max effort for well-scoped and sustained implementation under an understood architecture. Escalate consequential uncertainty.
- **claude-opus-5-5**: requested replacement for Fable in specification drafting and independent code review. Keep it out of active defaults while supported exact-ID use on a permitted host and harness remains unproven. No effort or context setting is assumed; retain unknown capability as unknown.
- **claude-fable-5** — (nickname: fable): deep product judgment, difficult planning, implementation and whole-system review.
- **claude-opus-5** — (nickname: opus): sustained engineering, orchestration, specification and independent review. This policy explicitly replaces the previous Opus 4.8 mapping.
- **claude-sonnet-5** — (nickname: sonnet): bounded orchestration, specification and implementation under an understood contract.
- **claude-haiku-4-5-20251001** — (nickname: haiku): narrow factual extraction and classification with inspectable evidence. No effort setting is assumed.

## Select and recover

Frugality is part of choosing the best agent. Choose the least costly qualified
model and effort expected to complete the actual remaining work to the required
quality. Spend more where the task's unresolved judgment, likely rework or useful
retained context warrants it. Project importance, a broad domain label or the
holder's previous model does not establish that need.

Count briefing and context reconstruction, supervision, synchronization, rework and
review along with the agent's own usage. Preserve useful context when it reduces
the cost of finishing; do not assume a model change requires a new session or
harness. Reconsider the choice when the remaining work changes, without creating
turns just to reassess it. Do not over-specify a job to fit it to a cheaper coder.

The ringdown rows suggest starting choices and fallback order; inference owns the
selection. Use their default order when the job supplies no reason to choose
differently. Choose another qualified candidate when its task fit, retained context,
expected total cost or availability better serves the outcome. A default or model
preference is not a compulsory first attempt, a price ranking or automatic fallback.
Use available cost and usage evidence without inventing prices or guaranteed cache
reuse across sessions, models or harnesses. Routine selection needs no benchmark,
new scoring ceremony or approval request.

Determine permitted families from the organization's instructions. Filter candidates
for mixed, Codex-only or Claude-only operation before choosing. Qualification still
requires the activity's capability floor, allowed host and harness, supported model
and effort, and runnable access. Catalog presence alone does not establish access.
Suggested order can change; explicit family, authority and budget restrictions cannot.

For an explicitly requested Claude slug, absence from a compiled inventory or the
provider's `/v1/models` response does not establish provider rejection. Preserve
unknown-slug pass-through on a supported route without alias substitution; do not
turn these preference tables into an offered-set allowlist. Retain actual host,
harness, version and credential validation and report provider refusals truthfully.
An explicit pass-through request does not qualify an unsupported active default.
If the installed route refuses the request, report that limitation to the existing
model-access owner. Do not bypass the refusal or claim that pending routing work
is already available.

Use an applicable activity for the actual outcome; the rows are not required stages.
Commission stronger planning or use a stronger agent throughout when the work needs it.

Expand nicknames to canonical models above. Pass the chosen model, effort and matching
permitted harness explicitly when spawning. Verify supported settings rather than
inventing a similarly named model. Archetype metadata does not make the selection
or implement fallback on the caller's behalf.

Independent review requires independent session and judgment. In mixed mode, prefer
the other provider family when candidates are otherwise comparably suitable and
frugal. That is a default preference, not an acceptance gate. A qualified same-family
reviewer remains eligible; single-family operation stays within its permitted family.
Choose the deeper review activity when the subject requires it.

On an unavailable route, reassess the remaining qualified candidates using the same
selection judgment. The suggested fallback order remains useful when there is no
reason to depart from it; a fallback may cost more. Do not retry a known unavailable
route without new evidence. If none qualifies, keep the obligation owned, record the
capability block and continue separable work. Reframe the work or propose a policy
change through its owner. Main is not a fallback worker. Report material consequences
through ordinary ownership, not each attempted or successful staffing choice.

A poor result requires diagnosis of the ask, inputs, context, dependencies and
approach. Increase effort, use a stronger activity or seek planning according to the
cause. Do not blindly demote by list position or repeat an uncertain external effect.
Preserve usable work and custody when replacing a holder or changing its harness.

Scale reasoning to expected task length and complexity. Astra low is not for
sustained work. Start sustained difficult work at high or xhigh rather than waiting
for a low-effort failure. More reasoning can produce a shorter plan; max or ultra is
not a default requirement. Report material product impact, budget issues or access
decisions through ordinary ownership, not every successful staffing choice.
